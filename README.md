This is a repository holding multiple mini projects done in the Practical Astronomy course (AST326) at the University of Toronto. This includes astrometry, spectroscopy, photometry and plate solving. In my second year, I did a Color-Magnitude Diagram project for the course Stars and Planets (AST221), which is also included in this repository.

Below are the descriptions of the projects from AST326:

I performed a spectroscopy experiment by using a neon emission spectrum which was calibrated and analyzed to determine the temperature of a blackbody source. The calibration method was then applied to analyze the 2D emission of ionized iron gas from a supernova using OH skylines, allowing estimation of the gas velocity. Finally, spectra of three stars, Aldebaran, Capella, and Elnath, were extracted after data reduction to remove noise and unwanted emission.

I performed a CCD astrometry experiment to measure the motion of the asteroid 26 Proserpina in the Solar System’s asteroid belt. Using star coordinates from the USNO B1.0 Catalog, a transformation matrix was derived to convert standard sky coordinates to pixel coordinates, accounting for magnification, shear, and rotation. Centroiding techniques provided precise Right Ascension and Declination values for each observation, and Python’s curve-fit function was used to determine the asteroid’s velocity,

I performed a photometry experiment by applying the standard data reduction process to delete any corrupted data and correct any overflow images. Then I conducted differential and aperture photometry to obtain the flux of a supernova explosion and analyzed the results by plotting a light curve of apparent magnitude against time.
